The reader will soon perceive with pleasure a great resemblance between the Persian and English languages, in the facility and simplicity of their form and construction ; both have no difference of termination to mark the gender, either in substantives or adjectives : all inanimate things are neuter ; and, animals of different sexes, either have different names, as پِسر pisar, a son , a boy ; کنِیز kanīz, a girl ; اسْپ asp, a horse ; مادِیاں madiyaṅ, a mare ; or are distinguished by the words نر nar, male, and ماده mādah female; as شیرِ نر s͟hēr-e nar, a lion ; شیرِ ماده s͟hēr-e mādah, a lioness ; these particles, however, are usually applied to irrational beings. 56. Arabic words indeed are often made feminine by receiving a silent (خفی Art. 29) final ه, as معْشُوق maɛs͟hūq, a friend; amicus, معْشُوقه maɛs͟hūqah , a mistress ; amica, as in this verse : گُل در بر وَ مَےْ بر کفُّ و معْشُوقه بکامسْت The rose in my bosom, the wine on my palm, and the beloved is to my desire. 57. But, if such noun do not signify a rational being, they consider it as neuter, and change the final ة into ت, and drop the (◌ٌ) tanwīn, as نِعْمةٌ niɛmatun, a benefit, نِعْمت: and, indeed, nouns ending in ت, are, for the most part, borrowed from the Arabs.
